EXILE   Peter JM Irvin & Jeremy C Smith 26/7/88_____The game is largely complete although we are unhappy with some of the puzzlesand hazards in the lower right and central left parts of the cave system.At the moment you can get through these parts too easily with guns blazingand so we are altering them to force the player to use his brain a bit more.(These are mostly encounters with creatures and will include puzzles to do withfeeding or trickery).In general the objectives as the player sees them are as follows...        The player starts off knowing that he must terminate the evil        Triax and rescue any survivors of the previous landing party.        (He is told this at the end of the book by the Columbus Force        commander-in-chief).                  At the start of the game the player sees Triax steal the        "Destinator" from the players own space ship. Now in order        to escape himself the player must retrieve this device.        The player knows from the book that the wicked Triax lives in his        laboratory deep down underground.  He knows that there is a        "rune portal" to the west (left) with a passage beneath it        leading to the lab. This door can be reached early in the game        but is closed tight. The player thus looks for a means of        opening this rune door.  It is too strong to be destroyed        by grenades or guns (as told in the book) and requires        a nuclear explosion to open it. This is supplied by touching        together two large chunks of glowing uranium which can be        found deep down in the caves to the east. Unfortunately the player        cannot retrieve two of these lumps intact (for various reasons) but        discovers a means of manufacturing them. This process involves        placing one of the green "slimes" in its dormant state under a red        "acid drop" creature  -the acid reacts with slime and converts it        into pure uranium - an element permeating all the rock deep down        and the reason for the mutation of the previous civilisation of old        into the imp creatures of today.        However to get the slimes into a dormant state you must feed them.        They eat small fragile crystals of the nuclear material.        These can be made by throwing mushrooms into fire.                Of course to get to the nuclear material the player has to have        passed through the ill-fated landing party's base (with all its        defenses still energized). Also he cannot pick up any pieces of        radioactive material without first have eaten the radiation pill.        (The player also knows that there is a transporter in Spiegels        lab that goes to Triax's lab (but this is switched off and he wont        find Spiegels pass until late in the game).                 There is a friendly pet robot ("Chatter" in the book) which        can be found in the base. This will follow you if you whistle        and will sometimes electricute evil creatures. Chatter has        been adjusted to convert the nuclear crystals into energy for itself.        He can give up his energy to you in the form of power pods (so a        steady supply of energy is assured in the later stages of the game).        The cannon in the upper cabin of the part-dismantelled space ship        can be fired using its own remote control. It cannot be moved        out of the top cabin until the player finds the pass Spiegel        dropped (as per the book) deep down in the west.        On exploring the western caves and passages the player will        trigger into activity Triax's personal servants which are        four very powerful robots that can fly and teleport. These will         chase the player every where. The player has to devise a        means of eliminating them (like using the dismantled engine in        the base, using the cannon, or using a nuclear explosion).        Triax himself makes short appearances occationally early on        in the game while the player is deep down. He stays around longer        later in the game but always teleports away when he's hurt badly.        When the player reaches the bottom of Triax's lab he finds the        maggot making machine above the waterfall and sees the missing         Destinator.  There is a switch that controls the level        of the water. It can be mmade to rise high enough        to short out the maggot machine which explodes violently        and causes an earthquake that floods the cave system.         Meanwhile the player can reclaim his destinator and         get to the two remaining members of the landing party        and bring them (using the transporters) to the surface        base and then on to the players space ship. They have been        heavily drugged and must be pushed around.         Replacing the Destinator in the front of the ship causes the ship's        engines to fire and the game ends."Crib" for pre-release version dated 25/7/1988 (last digit of entry code is 9)______________________________________________________________________________The following text describes a sensible route through the game.Most of the hazards and puzzles can be treated in several ways depending onthe ability/dexterity/intelligence of the player.Some of the locations are labelled (eg A,B,A2,B2,etc)and are marked on the map provided. Also the operations are numberedso that you can refer to them easily. It starts with some detail to give the gist of playing efficiently.  (1)(A)Start in space ship (A).Type in the password, press the switch (this unlocks the airlock doors).(Locked doors have a coloured rectangle at their centre.On unlocked doors this is black.)  Leave the ship.You start of with no weapons.Fly down to the right, pick up and store away the grenade which is behindthe bush on the surface of the planet. Fly left under the partly dismantelled spaceship of the ill-fated landing part.Press the teleport location remember key (R) because this is a safe place.(2) (optional)(B)Stand on the landing gear centrally beneath the tubes.Do a big jump (pressing @) and thrust up the tubes, knock the cannon,and get into the upper cabin (B) to pick up the second grenade.Fly down the tubes again (or teleport down and re-remember this position). (3)(C)Go left under the ship and, evading the defensive gun turret as best you can,fly down into the "porch" (C).Shelter from the bullets under the overhang and store your teleport position.Stand just onto the "grass" part of the floor and throw a grenade sidewaysto the right. The grenade will bounce off the wall and land on the door.(If it doesnt you better go and pick it up, press SPACE then S and haveanother go).Before it explodes lie down on the left to shelter from the blast. Only the green/yellow doors can be destroyed by a grenade).                                                                 (4)(D)Go down into the room below.Store your position again (because this is safe).Fly down, left & up, down to... (5) (optional)(E)Go left into this cave and pick up the grenade avoiding the bees.Leave this cave and fly down to... (6)(F)Save your position.(7) (optional) (recomended)(H)Place a live grenade on the step by the green/yellow door to blow it openand thus reach the first gun in (H) "the outpost".(The other way to get into H is to use the remote control device (RCD)described below and to get the pass at (N)).This gun is selected by pressing f1. Try experimenting with transferringpower between your jetpack and this gun. (8) (optional)(G)Get another grenade from here if you need it.(9)(I) The RCD (which you need to open doors and operate transporters) is in the fire.To get it you must put out the fire by collecting water in the flask anddropping it in the fire.To get the flask fly through the tube at (I) evading the pink imps.Theses imps throw blue mushrooms at you which clog up your jetpack nozzles for a while.They are frightened of the noise from your gun and will run away.(There is a secret trigger at (I) which opens the door above the fireand also the door into the flask room (J).(10)(J)Fly to (J), pick up the flask and fly to the right throwing the flask throughthe door.  Retrieve the flask and get it back through (I) to (K) where thereis water.  If there are any yellow birds around still you will need to dispose of thembecause they will hinder your water carrying exploits.Do this by shooting them or guiding them to (M) where one of the mortarshells from the turret will blow them to bits (and you too).(11)(K)Carry the water from here to (L) where you must place it on the door,store your teleport position and go to (I) to trigger the door open.(12)(L)Teleport to (L), pick up and store away the RCD. Lift the flask out of the pitback to (F).(Leave the flask and the RCD at (F) in case you drop them accidently whenyou deal with the white birds getting to...(13)(Q)Either get here using the transporter at (H) or fly there via (P) or (O).The birds at (P) can be disposed of (the poor feathery things) by drawingthem into the fire at (O) or shooting them lots of times or blowing themaway with a grenade (if you want to waste one).Go and get the pass in the wind on the surface of the planet. This pass now enables you to open the door at (R) using the RCD.(14)Teleport back to (F) to get the RCD and carry the flask back to (D) (15)(R)Destroy the hovering ball sentries at (R) by shooting them. Then open thedoor with the RCD.(16)(S)Fly down the passage towards (S) shooting the robot off the edge intothe pit.  Fly over onto the table at (S) and stand on its right hand endshooting at the top left hand edge of the table (which is indestructable).This will move the table to the left allowing you to descend through thesecret passage beneath.(17)(V)There is a hover robot in the right hand tube and more sentries in the lefthand tube. Both can be dealt with by your gun or grenades or just rush pastsince they only appear if you stay under the tubes.(18)Shoot through the transporter beams at the gun that sits on the switch.You will be able to knock it into a transporter and then go after it. This is gun 2 and does more damage than gun 1 but uses more power.Experiment with the switch (fire at it).  This changes the destinationlocations of the 2 transporters. One of the destinations goes to...(19)(W)Get the pass just to the right of the transporter at (W).This enables you to open the door into the little cabin in the space shipand so get the jet pack booster.  Do so.  From now on holding downthe @ key while you thrust will accelerate you faster.(20)(X)Fly to near (X) and get "Fluffy" the furline before it kills itself byleaping in the fire at (Y2).(This problem will be fixed in the final version of the game).    Instead of going through the mushrooms you should shoot a gun at the groundto make a noise.  This frightens poor little Fluffy which will comeover to you. Put it somewhere safe (like (Y)).Go back and get the flask and take the flask to (Y).(21)(Y)Fill the flask with water and take it all the way around (down,left,up)and place it carefully on the ground at (X1).  Go down to (Y1) andlie down to the left and fire at the switch through the crack.This will push you through into (Y2).(22)(Y2)Store your teleport position near the switch and fly back through the crackto (Y1). Go back for the flask. Put it to the left of the horizontal door.Teleport back to (Y2) and press the switch.  This will put out the fire.Now take the empty flask down the tube to (Y3) and throw it up fast (and shoot up at it if you like) so that it bounces of the ceiling andeventually hits the switch. Meanwhile stand by the door into (Y4) and beready to rush into the lower room at (Y4).(23)(Y4)Get the pass (which opens the doors at (W1)). The heavy boulder here canbe got out but is rather tricky so leave it for now.Go back to (V) (teleport).(24)(V)By shootin gat it again get the switch to the position that lets youget to (W1) where there is a turret in a passage between some doors.Throw a grenade into the transporter to destroy the turret.Have a look to make sure it was destroyed.Now go and get Fluffy and take it with you to (W1).(either through the transporters or destroy the other turret with the stronger gun (gun 2) and go through the double doors using the RCD). (25)(W1)Open the left door using the RCD and take Fluffy up to (M2).Leave it here and fly up to (M3) and destroy all the sentries in thetube. (Use the weaker weapons where ever possible since it uses less energy).Go back and bring Fluffy to (M3) and while thrusting right and lying downthrow Fluffy through the crack (following it up with a few well placedbullets) to push it through to the other side (M4).(26)(M4)The idea is to get Fluffy to knock the switch on the wall.  It should dothis of its own accord eventually, but you might try shooting at it toget it to the far end of the room.  However while it is making itsfrightened sqeeks you shouldn't stand in its view or it will comerushing towards you for comfort.When it has knocked the switch ONCE make lots of noise and show yourselfto it through the crack - you want to get it back out of (M4) to stop ittouching the switch again.This switch turns off the turrets at (M) and (U1) (and also produces powerpods from a tube above (M4)).Take Fluffy to (M) by using the transporter at (W).   (27)(M)The turret here has been deactivated so you can get the cannon remotecontrol from out of the cavity in the pit by putting fluffy in there(just like you did above).  You wont need to use the cannon for ages yetbut its wise to get its remote controller now in case something happensto Fluffy. Put this remote control somewhere safe (eg with the cannon).You can leave Fluffy in the pit for now.(28)(U)Go to (U) via the transporter at (T) shooting the robots out of the way. Pick up the power pod above (U) then use the RCD to open the door into...(29)(U1) Go right and down through the tube into (M4) and press the switch again andagain. Collect all the fragile power pods that fall from the tube abovebefore they decay. Remember to leave the switch in a state that has disabledthe turrets or you'll get a nasty surprise.(30)(X2)You are now all set up to go down deep to the east - down the greatwindy shaft.  To do this you must go and get a boulder. The one at (X2)is easiest to obtain.  Shoot it out of the mushrooms with a gun.Pick it up and carry it to the windy shaft and thrust down using yourbooster.  Be careful never to drop the boulder or you are are half doomedThere is only one more boulder at the top (Y4). You must always rememberto bring the boulders up the shaft with you when you want to go up.(40)(AA)At the base of the great windy shaft (AA) you should walk left a bitstore your teleport position and drop the boulder. Now thrust quickly to...(41)(AA1) There is another pass floating in the foliage to the right.  Fetch it evadingthe pirana fish.  DONT KILL THE BIG FISH - you'll need it later, and besides,it isn't hurting you. This pass opens the doors at (W2),(G),(M), anddeactivates the transporters at (V1).Now take the boulder back up the shaft leaving it somewhere safe (like (W)).You have a teleport destination at the bottom of the shaft now so getting backdown is easy.(42)(V)Go to (V) and switch off one of the transporters using the RCD.Move up into...(43)(V1)The protection suit is in the upper chamber here.  However the turret atthe top will lob grenades at you - lots of grenades.  I'm afraid the onlyway to get at the suit is rather awkwardly to leap in and shoot it offthe shelf or just grab it. REMEMBER to make the most of your teleport here.These grenades can be picked up and deactivated and stored away - so you havefound an infinate supply of them. Pick some up.The red suit uses up energy whenever you are hurt and must be re-chargedlike the guns.Go to (W2)(44)(W2)Destroy the turret with the stronger gun. Open the door into professorSpiegels laboratory with the RCD. Go under the engine that Spiegel hasbrought down "for repairs". The switch runs the engine but shouldn't bewasted since it runs out of fuel quickly.  You can use this engine todestroy one of Triax's hovering servant robots later in the game.Move down and left to...(45)(W5)Ignoring the robot throw a grenade through the crack in the rock abovethe transporter.  This should blow the robot into the transporter beam.Do the same to get the other de-energized robot ("Chatter") into thebeam or just shoot him around until this happens.(See the comments about "Chatter" above. You will need to feed him withcrystals of uranium which can be obtained by collecting mushrooms andpassing them through fire. Wait until you have obtained the radiationprotection pill...Go all the way east to the crack at (Z) (46)   (Z)Thrust up and right into the thin crack above the block of stone and squeezethrough the other side (Z1). This takes a bit of practice but you'll getused to it. Most of these cracks in the game cannot be negotiated withoutsome external force to push/suck you through. All the cracks on ceilingscan be traversed.(47)(Z1)Place 2 grenades next to the bee-hive and retire out of range of theexplosion which will destroy the hive.This route is now an alternative way down to the depths to the east.Continue down to...(48)(BB1)Here you will see the radiation pill in the crevice. There is a "Suck" bushinfront of it which prevents you (or Fluffy) getting through.  Shoot the groundaround here until one of the weak pink maggots appears and dump it in the Suck.This excites the Suck which draws everything nearby towards it in a strongcurrent of wind. You can get the radiation pill out this way. ...I will leave the rest of the exploration of the lower eastundescribed since this is unfinalised. Just get 2 of the largeuranium lumps to the rune portal at (Q1) as described far above. Be carefulnot to touch them together before you get them there or you will regret it....(200)(Q1)Put one uranium lump on the rune door.  Take the other and throw it froma place of safety onto the first.  This destroys the door, enabling yourdescent into the dangerous dark depths of the western caves and ultimatelyto the laboratory of the evil Triax.... I will leave the rest of the exploration of the middle west undescribedsince this is unfinalised.  You could go and get weapon 3 from (K) if youlike.  This weapon does a blast outward from you but uses lots of energy. Make your way down to above Triax's entrance hall at (ZZ) avoiding thehazards on the way....(300)(ZZ)There are 3 doors to be destroyed to the left.  Do this by attracting thecannon fire from the turret by firing bullets from weapon 2 at the doors.The shells will destroy the doors on impact. (Notice that the shells are the same sort as the ones the cannon in the spaceship fires.)   Now you should eliminate the turret by dropping a nuke in the angledhole just below left of the turret and then throw a crystal at the nuke.While you're here drop a crystal on the nuke sitting in the Suck below.Go left to into the big windy cavern and fly up the right hand edge, leftand down along the passage at (XX).(301)(XX1) Fetch Spiegels pass here. This enables you to operate the transportersat (B),(W4),and (YY).Go up, left along the top passage and down into the large cavern withthe lake and the yellow maggots. Swim down under the surface ofthe cool dark waters to trigger the activation of the robot. Thenteleport all the way back to your spaceship.  Fly down to (B).                                           (302)(B)Operate the transporter and push the cannon in.  Push the cannon out ofyour spaceship and down through (C) and (D).  You can shoot at the cannonto move it too.(303)(D)Blow open the door at (D) if you like.  Push the cannon down to the leftthrough (R) towards (S) to (T).(304)(T)Use the switch to lift the cannon into the transporter beam.(It will help later if you move the table along the same route as the cannon...)Push the cannon through (U),(U1) into the transporter to (W3)(305)(W3)Move the cannon to the edge of the pit and use it to blow open the dooron the left.  Then with the cannon back on the edge turn the cannon aroundto face right. Stand next to it to the right and fire it at yourself. This willproject the cannon over the pit into the little room on the other side.Use the transporter to get the cannon down to ZZ1.(306)(ZZ1)Destroy the turret through the crack by firing the cannon at it.  (It helpsto put the cannon on the table on the horizontal door here.(307)(ZZ3)Throw your RCD or Fluffy through the crack on the right.  It will hit theswitch at (ZZ2) and open the door. Continue down blowing open the doorswith the cannon through (ZZ3) until you reach (ZZ2).(308)(ZZ2)Leaving the cannon by the switch go through the door under the switchand store your position. Come back again and place the table on the cannon(or the flask on the cannon) directly under the switch so that when the door is opened the switch is knocked by one of the objects as they arethrown up into the air by the door.  Teleport back to the position just rightof the door,  rush down to just above the lower door and fire a bulletor throw Fluffy up to hit the door.  Rush down store your posn and up again before the door closes.  Now go back for the cannon and push it down into thelower section. Press the switch. Teleport down.This will do for now .......
