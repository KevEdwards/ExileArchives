He willhave to pick up these units to build up his reserve energy supply.The energy usage of the various weapons and the jetpack can be documentedin the manual, along with other technical info.The enclosed map shows the full extent of the underground system. Theupper part, which has been explored by the previous landing party,should be included with the game.  The detailed parts of the map willchange, and the enclosed version does not include locations of doors etc. We have decided on the general path the player will have to take aroundthe tunnel system, but not the details of getting through the base orwhere important items should be.  In this respect the enclosed game is VERYprovisional, but such things as the re-directing of transporters andlocking of doors can be seen to be powerful aids to creatinglogical puzzles - but it will require careful design and balancing.
